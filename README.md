# Structural Bioinformatics Training Workshop &amp; Hackathon 2017
Application of Big Data Technology and 3D Visualization,
San Diego Supercomputer Center, UC San Diego, June 26-28, 2017

This 3-day hands-on workshop introduces participants to the development of fast and scalable structural bioinformatics methods using state-of-the-art Big Data technologies and Web-GL 3D visualization (<http://mmtf.rcsb.org>). The first two days of the workshop combine lectures, hands-on applications, and programming sessions. On the third day participants apply the new technologies to their own projects.

This workshop is held at the University of California, San Diego and hosted by the Structural Bioinformatics Laboratory at SDSC in collaboration with the RCSB Protein Data Bank.

A second workshop will be held early 2018.
